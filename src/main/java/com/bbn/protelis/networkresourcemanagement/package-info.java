/**
 * This package contains the basis for a network resource management system
 * using Protelis.
 * 
 * <h1>Interpreting network flow</h1>
 * 
 * Interpreting network flow information with RX and TX values requires that one
 * knows the perspective that these values are with respect to. This document
 * explains how these values should be interpreted with examples to make it
 * clear.
 * 
 * The RX/TX values are from the perspective of
 * {@link com.bbn.protelis.networkresourcemanagement.NodeNetworkFlow#getSource()}.
 * 
 * If we have a node network flow 'f'
 * 
 * <pre>
 * NodeNetworkFlow
 *   nodeOne: A0
 *   nodeTwo: A1
 * </pre>
 * 
 * And a resource report showing network information as follows
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   ResourceReport.networkLoad
 *     f -> { DATARATE_RX=2, DATARATE_TX=6}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This means that node A0 is sending 6Mbps to node A1 and receiving 2Mbps from
 * node A1.
 * 
 * The same interpretation applies to
 * {@link com.bbn.protelis.networkresourcemanagement.RegionNetworkFlow}. The
 * values are from the perspective of
 * {@link com.bbn.protelis.networkresourcemanagement.RegionNetworkFlow#getServer()}.
 * 
 * 
 * The flow objects also have a "server" property. This specifies which
 * node/region is the server. This may not be the same as node two due to how
 * information is collected in the high fidelity environment.
 * 
 * 
 * When the network information is combined with the neighbor that it is
 * connected to one can gather some topological information. If we have the
 * topology "A - B - C - D - E" and node C sees the following report:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {
*   neighbor: B
*   flow: E -> A server: E,
*   TX=1,
*   RX=65
* }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This states that E is transmitting 1 through B to A. Based in this
 * information we know that to get to A from C we go through B.
